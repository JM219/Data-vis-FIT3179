                            Alice Springs however is one of the destinations that has decreased in use, primarily owing to the decrease in industry in the region after 1994. <br><br> 
                            After 2019, <b>COVID</b> had a massive impact on net traffic on all airports, largely owing to the state lockdowns preventing interstate travel in the hopes of stopping the spread of the virus. 
                            Only recently, in the last 4 months have airports started to pick back up but <b>not quite as high as what they once were this time in 2019</b>.

                            International foot traffic for all airports typically on makes up <b>10-25% </b>of the foot traffic each year. 
                            <br><br>Leading up to Christmas, airports have a long build up perios that quickly drops off in January and Febuary, when everyone makes it home.
